Example:\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * // Fragment:\n\t * var Container = Relay.createContainer(..., {\n\t *   initialVariables: {\n\t *     private: 'foo',\n\t *     public: 'bar',\n\t *     variable: null,\n\t *   },\n\t *   fragments: {\n\t *     foo: ...\n\t *   }\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * // Reference:\n\t * ${Container.getQuery(\n\t *   'foo',\n\t *   // Variable Mapping:\n\t *   {\n\t *     public: 'BAR',\n\t *     variable: variables.source,\n\t *   }\n\t * )}\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When evaluating the referenced fragment, `$public` will be overridden with\n\t * `'Bar'`.

If\n *    this is the initial mount (with no existing view), renders to null.\n *\n * In addition, supplying a `renderLoading` that returns undefined has the same\n * effect as not supplying the callback. (Usually, an undefined return value is\n * an error in React).\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by any of these callbacks can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...data} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted.
